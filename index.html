                <div id = "challenges_sect">
                    <p class = "challenges_text">> Our biggest challenge was voltage and the IR LED sensor. Many components required 4-5V 
                    but our battery only outputted 3.7V and the microcontroller only gave 3.3V. To address this issue, we had to use an 
                    adjustable boost regulator. While obtaining the component was easy enough, there were no wiring diagrams online so we
                    had to do extensive test to make sure we got the right voltage.<br>> The other problem was the sensor. At first we 
                    considered using a pre-assembled sensor, but we ended up getting our hands on 2 separate LEDs (receiver and emitter) 
                    It took a lot of measuring to find desired resistance to be able to sense walls at a fair distance. Even then, the 
                    wiring proved to be troublesome, as we hooked it up to digital pins instead of analog for a while.<br>> Finally, one 
                    other little issue was the encoders and h-bridge. These were the hardest components to use, since there was significant 
                    logic involved in the basic code. However, after understanding the motor waveforms and finding a pin diagram for the 
                    h-bridge, these problems were quickly addressed.</p>
